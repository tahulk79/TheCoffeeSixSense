# The Coffee Six Sense

**Brew → Taste → Compare → Discover → Improve**

A web-first specialty coffee learning game where players practice brewing, evaluate sensory qualities, compare past sessions, and record personal discoveries. **Discover Your Sixth Taste · From Coffee to Consciousness.** “Sixth Taste” is a metaphor for personal discovery, not a scientifically established sixth basic taste. The six sensory attributes are separate descriptors.

## v0.3 — The First Pour

Open **The First Pour · three stages** at the counter. Configure a fictional
Ethiopia Washed, Colombia Honey or Brazil Natural lot, dose, ratio, grind,
temperature and recipe time. Hold, use keyboard Space/Enter, or tap the pour
toggle through bloom → main pour → final pour. Each stage stops at its water
limit and waits for an explicit transition. Restart keeps the recipe.

Save the resulting game recipe, optional six-axis subjective intensities,
enjoyment, notes and next change in a separate Coffee Memory store. Compare two
entries, export JSON and delete individual records with confirmation. Game
scores, reflections, self-reported real tastings and the existing actual-brew
measurement collector remain distinct. Data is local to this browser and may
be lost when browser data is cleared; export backups. No accounts, VPS or new
network service.

## MVP gameplay
1. **Brew:** choose one of three starter beans and adjust dose, grind, water, temperature and pouring technique.
2. **Taste:** record aroma, acidity, sweetness, bitterness, body, aftertaste and personal impressions. Clearly distinguish simulated feedback from real-world sensory ratings.
3. **Compare:** review previous brews side by side, including settings and scores.
4. **Discover:** write hypotheses about what made a cup better or worse, preserving them in a personal Coffee Memory journal.
5. **Improve:** retry a brew using learned insights and earn progression rewards.

## MVP requirements
- Responsive web experience for desktop, iPad and mobile.
- Vietnamese and English localization.
- Local-first persistent session history and exportable journal data.
- Simple onboarding and replayable pour-over loop.
- Basic event tracking architecture, without launching advertising.

## Delivery plan
- **Phase 0:** audit and import existing prototype v0.1 code.
- **Phase 1:** complete end-to-end brewing and tasting loop.
- **Phase 2:** session history, comparisons, discoveries and progression.
- **Phase 3:** accessibility, mobile QA, analytics instrumentation and MVP release.
- **After MVP:** consider backend sync, domain, social accounts and marketing test.

## Constraints
- AI-assisted development; target AI/tool budget around USD 300.
- Web MVP first; native apps later.
- Initial marketing test budget USD 3,000, deferred until MVP is ready.
- No game-specific domain, social/advertising accounts or campaigns before MVP.

## Brew quests

The coffee journey includes four quests: save all three starter beans, record three discoveries, change exactly one setting between consecutive brews of the same bean and record the result, then save three brews of one bean with a simulated balance of at least 90. Quests unlock in order; existing saved history counts. Simulation goals are game mechanics, not objective taste measurements.

After changing frontend modules or styles, regenerate the GitHub Pages artifact and its local OCR assets with `npm run build:pages`. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`; tests reject a stale `docs/index.html`. Pages publishes this self-contained artifact through the manual Pages workflow.

## Personal beans (Phase 1 extension)

Players can photograph packaging and beans, review label details, fill missing fields and brew with their own coffee. Personal beans have no assumed target score. Profiles/photos stay in IndexedDB and can be exported. Packaging text is read locally on the player’s device using a bundled English/Vietnamese OCR engine; explicit label fields become reviewable suggestions. No VPS, API key or external AI service is needed. See [BEAN-AI.md](docs/BEAN-AI.md) for limits and reproducible builds.

## Status
The repository contains a playable Vite frontend with brew simulation, personal tasting reviews, local session history, comparison, discoveries and JSON export. Phase 1 provides a Vietnamese/English observation-and-choice pour-over game: quick start, three changing situations, immediate cause/effect feedback, optional tasting notes, save confirmation, and a one-change replay goal. History, comparison, four quests, XP and badges are available. The standalone Pages application is generated into `docs/index.html`. See [Phase 1 acceptance and validation](docs/PHASE1.md).

The active game is deployed on **GitHub Pages**. Legacy optional VPS preparation targets **https://cf.ta79.com** on Ubuntu/Nginx and is not required for the game. See [the deployment runbook](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for local verification, DNS, HTTPS bootstrap, restricted SSH deployment, approval gates and rollback. Production has not been provisioned or deployed by this change.
